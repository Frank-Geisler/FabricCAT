  # A little fun with Fabric Real-Time Analytics!
The Kusto engine inside Fabric Real-Time Analytics is the same powerful analytics engine you've grown to love over the years. I figured it would be nice to dust off one of our geospatial capabilities demo originally done by my colleague Michael Brichko and add a little twist!
What you will need to run this:
- 1 x Fabric enabled workspace
- 1 x KQL database (to run the code against)
- 1 x KQL query set (to execute the code)
- 1/2 cup of sugar
- 1/2 cup of rolled oats (wait wrong recipe! moving on...)

Ok, now on to the fun part!

Checking that you are connected to a KQL db
Head over to your KQL query set and make sure you are connected to a KQL database by looking to the left
Now go ahead and copy&paste the code snippet below to your KQL query set.

``` Kusto

```
These are used to create two scalar variable called "MyMysteryShape" and "MyMysteryShapeCutout" respectively. Both are created as DYNAMIC types and contain a valid GeoJSON polygon definition. In other words some shape, somewhere on earth!
## Line 3

``` Kusto
range i from 1 to 3000000 step 1 
```
use the range() operator to allows us to generate a set of rows based on a start and end condition. Think of this a a "while" loop. Here we are asking it to generate 3 Million rows. 
## Lines 4, 5 and 6
``` Kusto
| project  
            Longitude = (rand() * -100)
          , Latitude =  (rand() * -100) 
```
These are a prettified project statement that will create two new columns to go along with the 3 million rows we're generating on line 3 (remember KQL is sequential). But what are we projecting? we're essentially creating random longitudes and latitudes by using a random number between 0 and 1 using the rand() function and we are multiplying it by negative one hundred (-100). The reason is we want all of our randomly generated coordinates to be west of the prime meridian and south of the equator (in non pirate parlance: a negative longitude and latitude).
## Lines 7 and 8
``` Kusto
| where    geo_point_in_polygon(Longitude, Latitude, MyMysteryShape
  and not (geo_point_in_polygon(Longitude, Latitude, MyMysteryShapeCutout)))
``` 
##Line 9
``` Kusto
| extend val = rand(6)
```
We're now creating a new column to simulate a "value" using our trusted rand() function. This is adding some randomness so we have pretty colors in the end result :)
## Line 10
``` Kusto
| render scatterchart with (kind = map, legend = hidden)
```
We bring it home with a render command to show the remaining coordinates on a map using a scatterchart of type "map".
** Nerd alert **
The image you see is placed all the way near Antarctica for a few reasons:
- There's plenty of ocean there, making for a nice "canvas"
- The Mercator projection that allows us to "flatten" the earth in 2D makes it a bit easier to draw in the extremely high latitudes. Things get a bit more squished near the equator.

That's it folks, Hope you enjoyed this nugget of KQL fun and we'll be back soon with even cooler stuff!
